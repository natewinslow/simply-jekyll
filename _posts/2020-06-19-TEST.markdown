title: Can I Get This To Work? 
tags: nw test
---

This is my second test at trying to get something I wrote in VSC to automatically push to my Github repository.

The first time I tried this, I somehow ended up with a duplicate simply-jekyll folder inside of my local folder that stores my website. 

Was that because I cloned the git repository into VSC instead of just adding the local folder? I'm not sure. 

Now, if I'm not cloning, will the commits even work when I push them?
